        rewrote several box office records and emerged as the highest-grossing Indian film at that point, establishing
        Prabhas as the first pan-Indian star.[11][12] Commercial success has since varied, with action thrillers Saaho
        (2019) and Salaar: Part 1 – Ceasefire (2023) emerging as box-office hits.

        Prabhas is the first Indian actor ever to have four ₹100+ crore opening films worldwide, a feat unheard of in
        Indian cinema.[13] He is also the only South Indian actor to have five films that crossed the ₹100 crore mark in
        the Hindi market.[14][15] He is the first South Indian actor to receive a wax sculpture at Madame Tussaud's wax

        for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu.

        In 2010, he appeared in the romantic comedy Darling which received positive reviews upon release. The Times of
        India gave a 2.5 star rating explaining "Director Karunakaran extracts good performances from his actors, but
        can't come up with a refreshing plot. It looks like the director hasn't really come out of his Tholi Prema
        hangover as he dishes out yet another one-sided love saga but fails to come up with a valid and logical reason
        to make a GenZ lad to hold back his feelings for his lover until the last moment. However, he compensates it
        all, by adding loads of fun moments in the film and the screenplay does have its share of some touching
        moments."[27]

        In 2011, he appeared in another romantic comedy Mr. Perfect. The review site GreatAndhra rated the film with
        three stars and noted "The film comes across as a clean, family entertainer and the intention of the makers must
        be appreciated.[28] His performance in the film earned him his fourth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best
        Actor – Telugu.
